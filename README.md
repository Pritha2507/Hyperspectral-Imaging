# Hyperspectral Imaging for Mycotoxin Prediction in Corn Samples

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hyperspectral imaging data to predict mycotoxin levels in corn samples. The solution involves preprocessing spectral data, applying dimensionality reduction techniques, training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning and an attention-based model (transformer) are explored for enhanced prediction accuracy. A Streamlit app is included for user interaction, allowing spectral data uploads and real-time predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalization, and spectral feature extraction.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA, t-SNE, or Autoencoders to reduce high-dimensional spectral data.
- **Model Training:** Machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing models using Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization.
- **Transformer-based Model:** Implementing an attention mechanism for spectral feature learning.
- **Evaluation & Visualization:** Performance metrics, confusion matrices, and spectral feature importance plots.
- **Interactive Web App:** Streamlit-based UI for spectral data upload and prediction visualization.


## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using RMSE, R-squared, and MAE.
